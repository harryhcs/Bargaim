## Design choices
- Given the time I have tried to keep everything as simple as possible and followed the design document to the minimum.
- I also did not use Redux for thi project, its simple enought to just use local state for each component in my mind.
## Obstacles and resolutions
- I have never really used unit testing much so this was where I lost most time
- This is the first project I built using Typescript, so not sure how correct my code is, but I am super keen on learning it properly, it makes sene why one would use it, especially in a team.
## Sources

## Tiem spent on project
- Spent about 1 and n half days in total on this, so very rushed!
## Given more time, what would have been different?
- Extract API calles as a class with methods for each api call needed
- Resued allot of code and built out as some smaller components, like list views etc
- Implemented the design more carefully
